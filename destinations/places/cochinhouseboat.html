                <p>On arrival you will be met by our representative & transferred to Kumarakom - is an emerald peninsula of paddy fields, meandering lagoons and backwaters that juts out into Lake Vembanad. Perhaps more famously knows as the backwaters this area is unique being made up of labyrinth of canals and lakes that stretch between the capital Cochin and Quilon in the south. From the vastness of Lake Vembanad to the quiet streams just large enough for a canoe, the Backwaters form the arteries through which rural daily life calmly flows - children splashing in the water, women washing clothes at the water's edge, fishermen up to their necks in water digging out fish with their feet, rice barges transporting coconuts and rice (the staples of the Keralan diet) and, above all, an overriding sense of peace and tranquility that permeates every aspect of this stunning region. Upon arrival check in. Rest of the day is free for leisure. Overnight stay in Kumarakom. </p>

And the combination of any of these elements exists in each one of us. Ayurveda the traditional form of Indian medicine was developed by ancient sages whose astute observations led to the development of constitutional medicine. The ancients visualized the universe as a constant play of energies, an imbalance of which created discomfort and disease in the body. It was the duty of the vaidya (physician) to harmonize this imbalance of the body - mind environment. Overnight stay in Kumarakom. </p>
